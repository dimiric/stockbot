<b> WARNING - Not functional </b>

This is a work in process.  By no means think that this is a functional program, only written as pieces to do certain tasks for now.  I'll be trying to finish those tasks first, and then I'll come back to make it more useful as a full program.

Stage 1)
- Build a database
- Grab the latest list of stock symbols
- Download various frequencies of stock activity.  1 min, 5 min, etc.
- Read data and analyze against specific (already available) stock libraries
- Evaluate outputs and design a way to show results of each analysis method
- How much would each strategy have collected if automated

Stage 2)
- Build the automatic trader
- Run the trader in papermoney mode (not the TD Ameritrade Papermoney)
